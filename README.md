# ANDC
Affective Naturalistic Database Consortium


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Please make sure the following dependencies are installed before using this repository:

* openSMILE: https://www.audeering.com/research/opensmile/
* Montreal Forced Aligner: https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
* Whisper: https://github.com/openai/whisper
* Conda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/

### Installing
Once all dependencies are installed, you can setup the different conda environments to be used by going to /ANDC/env_setup and running 
```
bash create_conda_envs.sh
```
Additionally, you can download the models by running:
```
bash download_models.sh
```
Additionally we use "aligner" for the MFA environment as defined in [MFA installer](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)



### Executing program
* Create a directory and place all collected audio/video clips inside (i.e., /ANDC_batches/2023_7_29/audios)
* Run the script providing the batch directory
```
bash run.sh -r /ANDC_batches/2023_7_29
```
* All files will be saved inside the provided directory. Mainly Short_files.json will be created which aggregates all the information (segmentation, gender, music, SNR, emotions, etc). Furthermore, a directory will be created named Outputs which will contains the short and long audio clips as well as extracted features such as ASR.


<h2 align="left" id="coming-soon">TODO ðŸ—“</h2>
* [x] Add details for the json files
* [x] Add details on the file structure used in Outputs
* [x] Remove extracted features once all inference has been complete
* [x] Add GPU support
